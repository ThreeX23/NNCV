The models are placed in the models map.
The model paths are placed in the checkpoints map.
Inside the checkpoints folder, each model and their variants are stuffed in another folder, for organizational purposes.

The codes have not been altered to run on their own, they have kept the same formatting as was meant for the project.

To run the code:
Paste the required model from the models map into the model.py file. Attach the path to the model, do not train the models, just evaluate.
The data has not been put on the repository due to the sheer size of the file.
